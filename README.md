Hyperioware app that is finally coming together!

The Hmote apps' primary uses are as a directory for local businesses and as a secure way to conduct business online within the local community. Additionally, a certain level of "gamification" will be built in with leveling and certain perks , bonuses, and discounts on Hmote products with various performance by each business.

Primary launch point will be as a web app. Primary registration and log in will be through email and password. Social media integration will be added in after initital functionality is established.

While Hmote will come with basic standard apps within the app that businesses can use virtually for free, businesses will also have the option of having custom apps developed that plug right into the Hmote structure.

Business is conducted by the members purchasing Hmote credits. Businesses will showcase their products and may take payment online as customers trade purchased credits for the products/services. Businesses will have the choice of portioning their credit balance to either savings (that will be automatically distrubuted to them twice a month through Paypal's mass distribution API) or cash account that may be used to reinvest funds into other businesses' products or Hmote products.

Once the app is functioning, a widget selection will be available for embedding in business websites as an iframe.
